# Sickness Simulation

## Objective

This program simulates the spread of an infection or disease through iterations or rounds. A function was created that takes two variables one being rate of contact and the other being the rate of infection, with these variables a simulation is made of 1000 people in the spam of 100 rounds or days. The simulation begins with only one infected person on day 1 with 999 people being healthy. If a person has been infected for more then 5 days then they are considered not only healthy but also immune. Once those immune have passed 25 days then they are once again capable of being infected. After each round or day it is printed how many are sick, how many are infected, and how many are immune. Plots were also displayed of each round. The mean of how many were infected per individual was also displayed as Ro.

## Programming Language
